# Federation Contract

For a federation to work, all providers need to come up with a federation contract to agree on.
See the [overview about the existing federation concepts and issues](../index.md).
So to make the user experience good, a lot of alignment between the providers is required.
The following pages document the "contract" that the federated back-ends have agreed upon.

::: tip Note
To join the federation, it is required to (mostly) fulfill these requirements and document differences for users in the "[Federation Aspects and Known Issues](../index.md)".
Nevertheless, these requirements are negotiable if there are good arguments for a change as the current state of the "contract" is just the compromise that the existing providers have agreed upon and if a new back-end joins the federation new compromises may need to be made.
