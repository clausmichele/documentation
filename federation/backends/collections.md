# Collections

If back-ends offer/mirror the same datasets, it is required to align names and metadata. For the following collections and metadata an agreement has been achieved. These are all Copernicus Missions, and the standard names refer to the archives prepared and distributed by ESA. When it is not possible/desirable to use this name as collection id, a 'common_name' can be added next to the 'id' property that identifies the collection as a standard archive.


- SENTINEL1_GRD
- SENTINEL2_L1C
- [SENTINEL2_L2A]( ./collections#Sentinel2-L2A)
- SENTINEL3_OLCI_L1B

## Sentinel2-L2A

The common name for this collection is 'SENTINEL2_L2A'. It refers to the L2A products generated using the Sen2Cor software, which can be configured compatible with the products generated by ESA. Note that products in the ESA archive have also been processed with different versions of Sen2Cor, so it is not possible to specify a very specific version or configuration of the processing chain. 


### Bands

Band names for spectral bands follow the Bxx naming convention in use by ESA. For instance: B01, B02, B03, B08, B8A, B12

- `SCL` = the Sen2Cor scene classification band
- `approximateViewAzimuth` = collective term for the mean and accurate viewing azimuth angle. Depending on which backend is processing the data, the mean angle (for Sentinel Hub) or the accurate angle (for Terrascope) is used. If the accurate angle (`viewAzimuthAngles`) or the mean angle (`viewAzimuthMean`) is explicitly specified, the data is processed on the backend that holds the specified band.
- `viewZenithMean` = collective term for the mean and accurate viewing zenith angle. Depending on which backend is processing the data, the mean angle (for Sentinel Hub) or the accurate angle (for Terrascope) is used. If the accurate angle (`viewZenithMean`) or the mean angle (`viewZenithAngles`) is explicitly specified, the data is processed on the backend that holds those bands.

## Common Properties

We list a number of common properties here, that can be relevant for multiple collections. Collections are strongly encouraged to using these properties as opposed to using another name for the same property.
