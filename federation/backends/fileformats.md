# File Formats

If back-ends offer/mirror the same file formats for both import and export, it is required to align them.
For file export through `save_result` for example, the output parameters and the structure of the data that is written to storage needs to be defined.
For the following file formats an agreement has been achieved:

- GeoTiff
- netCDF
- JSON

## GeoTiff
