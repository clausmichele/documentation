# openEO Platform Editor

The *openEO Platform Editor* (also called *Web Editor*) is a browser-based graphical user interface for openEO Platform. It allows to use the openEO Platform services without any coding experience. You can explore the service offerings such as data collections and processes, but also create and run custom processes on our infrastructure and then visualize the results. Result visualization is still a bit limited, but all other features of the Platform are supported.

The Editor is available at https://editor.openeo.cloud and loads up the login screen. Here you can choose between "EGI" (to authenticate with EGI check-in) and "No credentials" (to not authenticate yet and just discover the service offerings). You can still login later if you've chosen to not authenticate yet.

After you've completed this step, you'll get redirected to the Editor itself with the discovery module on the left, the process editor (and user workspace, if authenticated) in the middle and the data viewer on the right.

You can always click the "? Help" button in the top right corner to get a guided tour through the Editor.
